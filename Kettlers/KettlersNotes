To Do:
-CurrentAvailApps
-Create list of chips to sell.
-Create lists of chips
-Create chip class (inputs oil, potato + 0-3 extra)
-Create population class
-Work on price multipliers
-Create supply and demand charts
-Work on gathering statistics about game progress (money made, money spent, rating, chip rating/per flavour, over time)
-Rating system: how well chip attributes match the current population attributes
-Grid ownership: build entire possible grid, hide inactive. Set price based on how many are left, and based on how full your current grid is
-Create production schedule, can produce up to n times a day (based on upgrades), each time the overhead has a basic cost. So you don't want to produce on little to no inputs
